A function doesn't necessarily need a return 
	if return doesn't exist, the function returns a None object 


PyPI - Python Package Index: Repo of Python software

Python package is nothing but a bundle of modules and __init__.py module

- named tuple 
>>> result=namedtuple('result','Physics Chemistry Maths') #format
>>> A=result(Physics=86,Chemistry=95,Maths=86) #declaring the tuple
>>> A.Chemistry

- tuple-packing 
>>> mytuple=3,4,5

- tuple-unpacking 
>>> x, y, z = tuple
>>> x + y + z

- How is memory managed in Python 
Python has a private heap space to hold all objects and data structures 
Python memory manager controls the allocation 
In-built garbage collector recycles all unused memory 

- unittest (testing module)
unit-testing involves testing different sections of the code 

- a set is mutable, a frozenset is immutable 

- set(filter(lambda x:x>4, range(7)))
- set(map(lambda x:x**3, range(7)))
- reduce(lambda x,y:y-x, [1,2,3,4,5])


API - Application Programming Interface 

What allows one piece of software to talk to another. 

Rest API 
RE - representational 
S - state 
T - transfer 

You make a call from a client to the server and you get data back over the HTTP protocol. 

In Restful API call, you pass on the state of an object to get back some resource.
